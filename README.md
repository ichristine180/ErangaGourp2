### E- Ranga Problem Statement

### Lost documents are a common problem that many people face, which can lead to a lot of inconvenience and stress. There is currently no centralized system in place for people to post information about lost documents, making it difficult for individuals to find and recover their lost items. This results in a time-consuming and frustrating process of calling or visiting different institutions and offices to check if the lost documents have been found.
### To address this problem, there is a need for a system that allows people to post information about lost documents and enables others to search for these items. The system should be user-friendly and accessible, allowing individuals to easily upload information about lost documents, including details such as the type of document, date of loss, and location of loss. The system should also have a search function that allows individuals to search for lost documents based on keywords or specific criteria, making it easier to locate lost items.
### Overall, the development of a centralized system for lost documents would greatly improve the efficiency and convenience of the process for individuals who have lost important documents. It would also reduce the burden on institutions and offices that are often contacted by individuals searching for lost documents, making the process simpler for everyone involved.
